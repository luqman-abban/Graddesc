# Introduction
Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

In this example, we use gradient descent to optimize the weights of a linear regression model. The goal is to find the weights that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values.
